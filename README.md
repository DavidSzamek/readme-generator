# Node.js: Professional README Generator

## Description

When creating an open source project on GitHub, itâ€™s important to have a high-quality README for the app. This project can quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application which allows project creators to devote more time to their work.

The goal is to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). Review the [Professional README Guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide) as a reminder of everything that a high-quality, professional README should contain.
